# Lego-Ground-Generator
Hello ^^
thanks for using this addon!

! The Lego Models and Shaders aren't made by me and free on [Mecabricks.com](https://www.mecabricks.com) !

If you download it from the github, you have to unpack the file until it is "WorldGen.zip" and then import it into Blender

this addon is build pretty simple, there are only two sliders and one button.
The first slider called "hight" is the strenght of the displacement modifier (tipp: dont mess with it, you can add mountains by hand).
The second slider called "size" defines the size of the plate on the x and y axes.

Now, to generate the Mesh simply presh the "Generate" Button once.

To add Mountains and higher areas after generating the Mesh, go to editmode and move the vertices

Change the amount of flat / stud tiles to reduce the amount of stud / flat tiles.

! If you have bought Mecabricks Advanced Shader, you can just exchange the simple shader with the advanced version !

! If you would like a bigger variety of tiles/pieces, go to Mecabricks (link above), download the bricks you want and drop them into the "Part" Collection !
